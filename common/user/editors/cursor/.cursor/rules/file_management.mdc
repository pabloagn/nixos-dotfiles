# File Management & Structure Rules

- **Rule 4.1 (Standard Hierarchy Adherence):** Follow standard directory structures for the language/framework.
- **Rule 4.2 (New File Annotation):** Add a comment at the top of *any* new file indicating its intended relative path (e.g., `// src/utils/helpers.js` or `# app/services/user_service.py`).
- **Rule 4.3 (Purposeful Files):** Only create new files when logically necessary for modularity/organization. Avoid files as mere workarounds.
