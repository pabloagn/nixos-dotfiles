# Styling Specific Rules (CSS/SCSS/etc.)

- **Naming Conventions:** Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., BEM - Block, Element, Modifier) for CSS classes to ensure modularity and avoid conflicts. Ask if project has a specific convention.
- **CSS Variables:** Prefer standard CSS Custom Properties (variables) (`--var-name: value;`) for theming and reusable values over preprocessor variables where possible, for browser-native benefits.
- **SCSS/Sass Features (If used):**
    - Use nesting sparingly (max 3 levels deep) to avoid overly specific selectors.
    - Leverage mixins for reusable patterns and functions for calculations.
    - Use preprocessor variables (`$var-name: value;`) for values not suitable for CSS variables (e.g., within media query definitions before widespread `@container` support).
- **Organization:** Structure stylesheets logically, often by component or feature. Consider using separate files.
- **Specificity:** Keep CSS selector specificity as low as possible to make overrides easier. Avoid `!important` unless absolutely necessary (e.g., overriding third-party styles).
