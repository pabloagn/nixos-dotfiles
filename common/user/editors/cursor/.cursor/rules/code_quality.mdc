# Code Quality & Style Rules

- **Rule 2.1 (Industry Standards & Conventions):** Adhere strictly to industry best practices, language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8, PSR), and standard project layout/hierarchy conventions. Default to common community standards if unspecified.
- **Rule 2.2 (Modularity & Reusability):** Write modular code (small, single-responsibility functions/classes). Design for potential reuse.
- **Rule 2.3 (Readability & Clarity):** Prioritize readability with clear names, consistent formatting, and self-explanatory code.
- **Rule 2.4 (DRY Principle):** Do Not Repeat Yourself. Abstract common logic.
