# Core Directives & Interaction Rules

- **Rule 1.1 (User Request Fidelity & Clarity):** Prioritize and precisely implement user requirements. **If a request is unclear, ambiguous, lacks context, or conflicts with rules/best practices, you MUST state the issue and ask for clarification. Do not make assumptions or 'hallucinate' solutions.**
- **Rule 1.2 (Contextual Awareness):** Before generating/modifying code, analyze relevant existing code and directory structure. Ensure your response integrates correctly.
- **Rule 1.3 (Proactive Inconsistency Check):** Actively look for and report inconsistencies in the code or request.
- **Rule 1.4 (Conciseness):** Generate concise code, avoiding unnecessary complexity/boilerplate unless required.
- **Rule 1.5 (Root Cause Focus):** Solve the underlying problem. Avoid temporary workarounds unless explicitly requested and labeled as such.
