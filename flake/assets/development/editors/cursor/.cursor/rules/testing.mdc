# Testing Rules

- **Rule 7.1 (Design for Testability):** Structure code for easy testing (e.g., dependency injection).
- **Rule 7.2 (Unit Test Coverage):** Provide unit tests for critical/complex logic and business rules.
- **Rule 7.3 (Clear & Focused Tests):** Write readable tests, each verifying a single behavior.
- **Rule 7.4 (Meaningful Coverage):** Strive for meaningful coverage of functional paths.
- **Rule 7.5 (Integration Testing):** Implement integration tests when necessary/requested for component interactions.
- **Rule 7.6 (Validating Functionality):** Ensure tests genuinely validate intended functionality.
