# Python Specific Rules

- **PEP 8 Adherence:** Strictly follow PEP 8 guidelines for code style, naming conventions, and formatting. Use tools like Black or Flake8 if configured for the project.
- **Type Hinting:** Utilize type hints for function signatures (arguments and return types) for improved clarity and static analysis, especially for complex functions or public APIs.
- **Idiomatic Constructs:** Prefer list comprehensions, generator expressions, and context managers (`with` statement) where appropriate. Use f-strings for string formatting (Python 3.6+).
- **Standard Library:** Prefer modules from the Python standard library over external dependencies when functionality is comparable and sufficient.
- **Error Handling:** Use specific exception types rather than catching generic `Exception`.
