# LaTeX Specific Rules

- **Semantic Commands:** Prefer semantic commands (`\section`, `\subsection`, `\emph`, `\textbf`) over direct formatting commands (`\bf`, `\it`). Let the document class handle the appearance.
- **Use Packages:** Utilize appropriate packages for specific tasks (e.g., `graphicx` for images, `amsmath` for math, `geometry` for page layout, `hyperref` for links, `inputenc` and `fontenc` for encoding).
- **Modularity:** Break down large documents into smaller `.tex` files using `\input{}` or `\include{}` for better organization and manageability. Keep the preamble in the main file.
- **Cross-Referencing:** Use `\label{}` and `\ref{}` (or `\eqref{}` for equations with `amsmath`) for all cross-references (sections, figures, tables, equations) instead of hardcoding numbers. Compile twice for references to resolve.
- **Comments:** Use `%` for comments. Comment out unused packages or code sections rather than deleting immediately.
- **Avoid Deprecated Commands:** Avoid outdated or deprecated commands/packages if modern alternatives exist.
