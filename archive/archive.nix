  # Observations
  # ------------------------------------------
  # - This is the package cementery, where all packages go to die.
  # - Any unmaintained package with potential side effects to my system is dumped here.
  # - Any package that has been outperformed by other package is dumped here.
  # - Any broken / quarantined package is dumped here.
